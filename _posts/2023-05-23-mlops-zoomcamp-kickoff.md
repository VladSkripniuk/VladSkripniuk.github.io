Introduction:
In this blog post series, I will share my progress as a student studying ML Ops. Topics covered include experiment tracking, model management, ML pipelines, model deployment, model monitoring, and best practices.

Throughout the course, I will learn the importance of tracking experiments and managing models effectively, as well as orchestration and building ML pipelines.

I will explore model deployment strategies, from cloud platforms to edge devices, and gain insights into model monitoring techniques for maintaining performance and reliability.

The course will also emphasize industry best practices for data governance, security, scalability, and reproducibility.

Join me on this ML Ops journey as we uncover the tools and knowledge needed to optimize the lifecycle of machine learning models.
